Usage example using CURL


1. Add an ID:
Option 1
Send a POST request to http://79.136.89.243/add
The request should have the header field Content-Type: application/json
and the data should be a json dictionary with keys "name" and "phone" and values as strings.

>>>>>> CURL COMMAND:
$ curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"Linus Mellberg", "phone":"0703916857"}' http://79.136.89.243/add

<<<<<< CURL OUTPUT:
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 21
Server: Werkzeug/0.9.4 Python/2.7.5

0f3_4QdgRjw-GIEqdduZ
<<<<<< END OF CURL OUTPUT

An an identifier is returned. This identifier can be used to request the added ID.

Option 2 (for testing)
There is also a GET version of the above. Can be run in a normal browser.
>>>>>> CURL COMMAND:
$ curl -i http://79.136.89.243/add/Linus/0703916857

Its the same as above but uses the URL instead of POST data.
http://79.136.89.243/add/name/phone

It will also return an identifier that can be used to request the added data.


2. Retrieve the previously added ID:

>>>>>> CURL COMMAND:
$ curl -i  http://79.136.89.243/get/0f3_4QdgRjw-GIEqdduZ

<<<<<< CURL OUTPUT:

Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 56
Server: Werkzeug/0.9.4 Python/2.7.5
Date: Fri, 04 Oct 2013 11:39:09 GMT

{
  "Name": "Linus Mellberg", 
  "Phone": "0703916857"
}
<<<<<< END OF CURL OUTPUT

A json encoded dictionary is returned.
